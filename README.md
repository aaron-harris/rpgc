# rpgc: The Roleplaying Game Compiler

This program is a work in progress.  When it is complete, it is envisioned
that `rpgc` will be a tool for players of tabletop roleplaying games.  It
is envisioned that the complete program will:

* Accept character sheets in a natural-feeling DSL format for a variety of
  tabletop RPG systems.
* Validate character sheets for rules consistency.
* Export character sheets into a variety of formats, including plain text
  and LaTeX.

Essentially, the idea is that you can compile character data in raw form into
a nicely formatted character sheet.  In addition to character sheets, the
program will support other kinds of data specific to particular RPG systems,
for example skills, spells, and equipment.
